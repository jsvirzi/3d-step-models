3D STEP model files

These are STEP models that I have taken from different places on the internet. 
I did virtually no work, other than to compile them here for my own use and access. 
Why not share the fine work that other people have done, however?

As such, I would like to point out that I have used many files from (snapeda.com)[snapeda.com]. 
Their products are high quality, and free.
I have also used files from (3dcontentcentral.com)[3dcontentcentral.com], which asks people to rate their models.
I do not want to cheat people from their ratings, so if possible, please use the links I provide, instead of the direct files themselves.
